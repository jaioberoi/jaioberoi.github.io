##### Data Science 
I analyze real world data to uncover or confirm new objective truths. 

##### Epidemiology 
My scientific curiosity mostly encompasses public health, genetic epidemiology, metabolic health, and aging. I am working on expanding to more diverse datasets. 

#### Machine Learning 
Adding in Machine Learning tools to my analyses will provide more futuristic conclusions. This required the question to be predictive as opposed to causal or exploratory.
