Hi!

My name Jai Oberoi, this is my [website](jaioberoi.github.io). 

I am a second year MPH candidate at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. I study Epidemiology and Biostatistics. 

Currently, I work at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where I investigate how biological aging predicts either pathogenic or healthy phenotypes. 

My research looks at telomere length as a predictor of healthy aging on metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive phenotypes.
